## Examples

This example:

```ruby
mariadb_configuration 'fake' do
  section 'mysqld'
  option :foo => 'bar'
end
```

will become the file fake.cnf in the include dir (depend on your platform), which contain:

```ruby
[mysqld]
foo=bar
```

In another example, if the value start with a '#', then it's considered as a comment, and the value is printed as is (without the key):

```ruby
mariadb_configuration 'fake' do
  section 'mysqld'
  option :comment1 => '# Here i am',
    :foo => bar
end
```

will become the file fake.cnf in the include dir (depend on your platform), which contain:

```ruby
[mysqld]
# Here i am
foo=bar
```
